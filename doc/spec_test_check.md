# Automatic spec test check generation

Kaocha can discover all of your fdefs and generate `clojure.spec.test.check`
tests for them. This saves you the trouble of writing your own boilerplate,
and gives you the truly "free" generative testing that clojure.spec promises.

There are two ways you can use this feature:

1. Adding `:kaocha.type/spec.test.check` test suites to your `tests.edn`:
    - `:kaocha.testable/type` = :kaocha.type/spec.test.check
    - `:kaocha/source-paths`: Normally your fdefs are with your code, so this
can probably be left defaulted at `["src"]`
    - `:kaocha.spec.test.check/checks`: Optional. If you want to
orchestrate multiple "sets" of checks with differing parameters, you can
specify them here. This is a collection of checks, each check being a map
which may contain the following optional keys:
        - `:kaocha.spec.test.check/syms`: Currently your only options are either
`:all-fdefs` (default) or to provide a set of the symbols for the fdefs
which you want to test. Eventually we will add `:other-fdefs` to select
all the fdefs that were not specifically mentioned in other checks.
        - `:clojure.spec.test.check/instrument?` Turn on orchestra instrumentation
during fdef checks<!-- TODO: isn't orchestra unnecessary in this context? Because property-based testing is when Clojure enables :ret and :fn specs by default? -->
        - `:clojure.spec.test.check/check-asserts?` Run s/check-asserts during fdef
checks
        - `:clojure.spec.test.check/opts`: A map containing any of:
            - `:num-tests`: Test iterations per fdef
            - `:max-size`: Maximum length of generated collections
        - All of the keys within each check can also be given in the top-level test
suite map to be merged by default into all checks.
2. The `kaocha.plugin.alpha/spec-test-check` plugin
    - This provides a sane default test suite for automatically checking all of
your fdefs. Spec test checking can be configured with more granularity in
tests.edn (as above), but the plugin exists for easy and simplistic CLI
control.
    - Regardless of whether you add the test suite(s) to `tests.edn` yourself,
you can also use this plugin to forceably override certain test
parameters:
        - `--[no-]stc-instrumentation` = `:clojure.spec.test.check/instrument?`
        - `--[no-]stc-asserts` = `:clojure.spec.test.check/check-asserts?`
        - `--stc-num-tests NUM` = `:num-tests`
        - `--stc-max-size SIZE` = `:max-size`
    - By default, this plugin also adds `:no-gen` to `:kaocha.filter/skip-meta`.
You might want to decorate an fdef-ed function with `^:no-gen` if there is
either no good generator for one or more of its arguments or if the
function is side-effectful.

## Detects and checks fdefs using tests.edn

- <em>Given </em> a file named "tests.edn" with:

``` clojure
#kaocha/v1
{:tests [{:type :kaocha.type/spec.test.check
          :id   :generative-fdef-checks}]}
```


- <em>Given </em> a file named "src/sample.clj" with:

``` clojure
(ns sample
  (:require [orchestra.core :refer [defn-spec]]))

(defn-spec ok-fn  boolean? [x int?] true)
(defn-spec bad-fn boolean? [x int?] x)
```


- <em>When </em> I run `bin/kaocha --reporter kaocha.report/documentation --no-randomize --no-color`

- <em>Then </em> the output should contain:

``` text
--- generative-fdef-checks (clojure.spec.test.check) ---------------------------
sample
  sample/bad-fn FAIL
  sample/ok-fn


FAIL in sample/bad-fn (sample.clj:5)
== Checked sample/bad-fn ====================

## Plugin: kaocha.plugin.alpha/spec-test-check

- <em>Given </em> a file named "src/sample.clj" with:

``` clojure
(ns sample
  (:require [orchestra.core :refer [defn-spec]]))

(defn-spec ok-fn  keyword? [k keyword?] k)
(defn-spec bad-fn boolean? [k keyword?] (ok-fn k))
```


- <em>When </em> I run `bin/kaocha --reporter kaocha.report/documentation --no-randomize --no-color --plugin kaocha.plugin.alpha/spec-test-check`

- <em>Then </em> the output should contain:

``` text
sample
  sample/bad-fn FAIL
  sample/ok-fn
```
